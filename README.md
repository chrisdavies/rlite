# rlite

Tiny, [fast](http://jsperf.com/rlite/2), light-weight JavaScript routing with zero dependencies.

- Order of route declaration doesn't matter: the most specific route wins
- Zero dependencies
- No performance drop as you add routes
- Less than 700 bytes minified and gzipped
- Parses query strings
- Wildcard support

## Usage

Rlite does not come with any explicit tie into HTML5 push state or hash-change events, but these are easy enough to tie in based on your needs. Here's an example:

```javascript
const route = rlite(notFound, {
  // Default route
  '': function () {
    return 'Home';
  },

  // #inbox
  'inbox': function () {
    return 'Inbox';
  },

  // #sent?to=john -> r.query.to will equal 'john'
  'sent': function (params, {to}) {
    return 'Sent to ' + to;
  },

  // #users/chris -> r.params.name will equal 'chris'
  'users/:name': function ({name}) {
    return 'User ' + name;
  },

  // #users/foo/bar/baz -> r.params.path will equal 'foo/bar/baz'
  'users/*path': function ({path}) {
    return 'Path = ' + path;
  },

  // #logout
  'logout': function () {
    return 'Logout';
  }
});

function notFound() {
  return '<h1>404 Not found :/</h1>';
}

// Hash-based routing
function processHash() {
  const hash = location.hash || '#';

  // Do something useful with the result of the route
  document.body.textContent = route(hash.slice(1));
}

window.addEventListener('hashchange', processHash);
processHash();
```

The previous examples should be relatively self-explantatory. Simple, parameterized routes are supported. Only relative URLs are supported. (So, instead of passing: `'http://example.com/users/1'`, pass `'/users/1'`).

Routes are not case sensitive, so `'Users/:name'` will resolve to `'users/:name'`

## Possible surprises

Keywords/patterns need to immediately follow a slash. So, routes like the following will not be matched:

    /users/user-:id

In this case, you'll need to either use a wildcard route `/users/*prefixedId` or else, you'd want to modify the URL to be in a format like this: `/users/user/:id`.

## Route handlers

Route handlers are functions that take four arguments and return a result and/or produce a side-effect.

Here's an example handler:

```javascript
const route = rlite(notFound, {
  'users/:id': function (params, query, state, url) {
    // Do interesting stuff here...
  }
});
```

The first argument is `params`. It is an object representing the route parameters. So, if you were to
run `route('users/33')`, params would be `{id: '33'}`.

The second argument is `query`. It is an object representing the query
parameters. So, if you were to run `route('users/33?lang=en')`, query would
be `{lang: 'en'}`.

The third argument is `state`. It is an optional value that was passed into the route function. So,
if you were to run `route('users/22', 'Hello')`, params would be `{id: '22'}` and state would be `'Hello'`.

The fourth argument is `url`. It is the URL which was matched to the route. So, if you were to run
`route('users/25')`, params would be `{id: '25'}`, state would be `undefined` and url would be `'users/25'`.


## Modules

If you're using ES6, import rlite like so:

```javascript
import rlite from 'rlite-router';

const routes = rlite(notFound, {
  '': function () { }
});

// etc
```

Or using [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) like so:

```javascript
var Rlite = require('rlite-router');
var routes = rlite(notFound, {
  '': function () { }
});

// etc
```


## Handling 404s

The first parameter to rlite is the 404 handler. This function will be invoked when rlite
is called with a URL that has no matching routes.

In the following example, the body will end up with `<h1>404 NOT FOUND</h1>`.

```javascript
const route = rlite(() => '<h1>404 NOT FOUND</h1>', {
  'hello': => '<h1>WORLD</h1>'
});

document.body.innerHTML = route('/not/a/valid/url');
```

## Changes from 2.x

- Route handlers take four arguments instead of three: query parameters are returned separately from route parameters.

## Changes from 1.x

- The parameters to route handlers have changed
- The plugins have been dropped since 2.x is more functional in nature, it's easy to extend
- rlite returns a function, rather than an object
- You can pass optional state into your route handlers
- The result of your route handler is returned by the router

## Installation

Just download rlite.min.js, or use bower:

    bower install rlite

Or use npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rlite-router

    npm install --save rlite-router

## Contributing

Make your changes (and add tests), then run the tests:

    npm test

If all is well, build your changes:

    npm run min

This minifies rlite, and tells you the size. It's currently just under 700
bytes, and I'd like to keep it that way!

## Status

Rlite is being actively maintained, but is pretty much feature complete. Generally, I avoid repos that look stale (no recent activity), but in this case, the reason for inactivity is that library is stable and complete.

## Usage with React

I've been using Rlite along with React and Redux. [Here's a write up on how that works.](https://github.com/chrisdavies/rlite/wiki/Using-with-React)
